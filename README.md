# MovieCleaner

### Description
This script is intended to be a quick cleanup script to take movies based on name in one directory and move them to another,
and put them inside a folder of the same name. Additionally it will look the movies up in an IMDB style db online, and return 
a movie poster inside the folder.

The script is in alpha stages right now, and will be modified to address variances in the name.
